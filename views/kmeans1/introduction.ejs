        <h5>1.1 The Clustering Problem</h5>
        <p>Cluster Analysis is sometimes also called <mark>data segmentation</mark>, because it has the overall goal of dividing a set of data into an arbitrary number of clusters or segments, with each segment ideally representing some form of commonality amongst its members.</p>
        <p>For example, streaming services like Netflix, HBO GO, Hulu, and the likes gain much from clustering their subscribers according to who might like a certain kind of content. A group that’s likely to click on a True Crime show probably likes to watch a lot of action, and a lot of documentaries. On the other hand, another segment of the subscribers that like to watch slower, slice-of-life dramas and romantic comedies may not exactly enjoy the same type of high-energy content. This is where a lot of the focus goes for these companies in terms of technology: their algorithms are designed to identify these kinds of clustering among customers to serve them the kind of content that will keep them using the platform.</p>
        <img src = "/img/screen_nflix.png" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" width = "65%">
        <div style = "height:25px">&nbsp;</div>
        <p>We can imagine another example this time for a more conventional business: fast food. You’ll often notice that fast food restaurants always tend to organize their menus in “groups”: you have the fully loaded meals, promos pairing certain meals with drinks, and then the value meals (very often they also have a separate “kids meals”). This organization is a more primitive version of the kind of targeted advertising that modern streaming companies do behind the scenes. Restaurants, even without the novel algorithms, are aware of what different kinds of customers are likely to buy, so they try to target that through their menus to maximize sales.</p>
        <div style = "height:50px">&nbsp;</div>

        <h5>1.2 Clustering At Work</h5>
        <p>What does this kind of segmentation look like in the data?</p>
        <p>We can imagine a fictional streaming company that keeps track of the aggregate hours of content that have been consumed by each subscriber across a wide set of labels representing different genres of content available on the platform. For example, we have the amount of content consumed for “action” and “comedy”.</p>
        <img src = "/img/plot_comedy.png" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" width = "45%">
        <div style = "height:25px">&nbsp;</div>
        <p>From the data, we can see a kind of separation happening between two groups of subscribers. The first kind appears to be consuming about 60 percentiles or more of Action content but only about 50 to 80 percentiles of Comedy. On the other hand, the second group, appears to be consuming much more comedy, at 70 to 90 percentiles, and equivalently less of action, with just about 50 percentiles.</p>
        <p>This data has obviously been simulated to make the separation quite visible, but in real life data, we often have more than two variables available, and the segmentation is not as straightforward. This is where our clustering algorithms come in.</p>
        <img src = "/img/plot_clustered.png" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" width = "45%">
        <div style = "height:25px">&nbsp;</div>
        <p>The goal of clustering is to be able to identify these separations and locate them in the data. Once we have located them, we can then begin assigning who belongs in which group. And for our fictional streaming company, we should then be able to make use of this information to recommend the right titles for each cluster.</p>
        <p>In the next lesson, we will explore a simple version of the algorithm that is in wide use in modern data science, statistics, and artificial intelligence engineering.</p>
